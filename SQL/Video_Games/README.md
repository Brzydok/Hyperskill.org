One day, I, a renowned SQL expert, was minding my own business in my office when suddenly, there was a knock on my door. 
It was a private detective who wanted to hire me for an urgent caseâ€”the disappearance of a well-known game developer. 
The developer left some diary excerpts and a random shapeless tangle of cells and columns with video game information. 
Only I, with my unique abilities, could decipher the riddle in the data in time to save the guy. Time was running out, and a person's life might be at risk.
