# School Database Recovery and Annual Score Calculation

In the face of a severe cyber attack on my school's IT system, where the database was maliciously destroyed, I, as the leader of the Science Club, was called upon for assistance. The situation was critical, with only one week remaining before the final annual exams.

To address the challenge, I took on the responsibility of creating the school database anew. Leveraging the data provided by the school management from the archives in CSV files, my primary objective was to recover and reconstruct the students' annual scores.

With determination and urgency, I embarked on the task of database recovery and annual score calculation, ensuring that the students' academic records were ready in time for the impending exams.
