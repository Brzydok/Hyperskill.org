A hacker has attacked the IT system of my school and destroyed the database. As a leader of the Science Club, my school has asked me my help. The situation was grave. 
There was only one week before the final annual exams. I needed to recover the annual scores of the students. The school management provides the data from the archive with csv files. 
My task was to create the school database and calculate the annual score.
