# Git Basics

In my journey with Git, I've mastered essential commands, empowering me to efficiently manage version control. These fundamental skills include:

- **Initializing a Repository:** Setting up the groundwork for version control.
- **Staging Changes:** Selectively preparing modifications for the next commit.
- **Making Commits:** Capturing snapshots of the project's state with meaningful commit messages.
- **Studying "ignore":** Learning how to exclude unnecessary files from versioning.

With these Git basics at my disposal, I am well-equipped to navigate version control and collaborate effectively on projects.
