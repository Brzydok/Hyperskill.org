# Zoo Animal Monitoring Tool

In response to a short code challenge, I've crafted a handy tool for the local zoo. This tool aids in monitoring the well-being and status of the diverse array of animals residing in the zoo.

With this tool in place, the zoo can efficiently track and manage information about its denizens, ensuring their health and safety.
