# Project Overview

I serve as an analyst in a dynamic company where the HR manager entrusted me with three datasets. The initial two datasets provide comprehensive insights into employee performance across Offices A and B. These datasets encompass key metrics such as work hours, salaries, project involvement, and departmental affiliations.

The third dataset is expansive, delving into employees' job satisfaction levels, their latest performance evaluation metrics, and their current status within the company.

My primary responsibility involved analyzing these datasets to address specific inquiries posed by the HR department.
