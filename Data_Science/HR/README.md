I work as an analyst in a company. The company's HR boss provided me with three datasets. The first two contain information about employees' performance in offices A and B: how much they work, 
their salaries, the number of their projects, departments, and so on. The third one is an extensive dataset with information on the employees' satisfaction with their jobs, 
their latest evaluation metrics, and the current status in the company. My task was to analyze the data and answer some of the HRâ€™s questions.
